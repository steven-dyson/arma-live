# About postgres.so
#
# Prefer the system provided when it does provide it. 
# If your system package manager allows you to get and install luasql-postgres
# then do that and delete my postgres.so
#
# Mine will probably require libpq.so* installed. 
# If it breaks for any reason, delete it and rebuild it using luarocks.

# At the time I did this, I had to add a new server to the list in /etc/luarocks/config.lua
# [[http://www.luarocks.org/repositories/rocks-cvs/]]
# when git is invoked it will fetch from github.com as well.

# If running on ubuntu, with a broken luarocks, add CFLAGS=-fPIC before "install"
# If it fails to find the postgres includes, POSTGRES_DIR=/path/to/postgres/9.0

rm postgres.so

luarocks install luasql-postgres
